# File Explorer.foundationalPythonProject

My foundational Python project. This simple script interacts with the operating system to read the contents of a specified folder and effectively filter the results to display and count only files, ignoring directories.

## What I've Learned

This project demonstrates foundational skills in **system interaction** and **data filtering**.

1.  System Interaction: Mastered the use of `os.listdir()` to read all elements within a directory.
   
2.  Path Construction: Applied `os.path.join()` to reliably construct the full path to an element, a critical step for system operations.
   
3.  Filtering Logic: Successfully used `os.path.isdir()` within an `if` statement to differentiate between files and folders, allowing the script to accurately count and display only file

## How to Run the Script

* Python 3 installed on your PC.

1. Download the project file.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Execute the script using the following command:

```bash
python PasswordGenerator.py
